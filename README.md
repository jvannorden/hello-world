# hello-world
Just another demo repository.

Figured I might as well figure out how to use this. Currently introducing myself to a bunch of new topic. 
My goal hear is to use this technology throughout my current coursework. Feel free to look around, I thought
this would be an effecient way to produce code samples for others to see. Plus I think it will be interesting to 
look at my own growth over time.
